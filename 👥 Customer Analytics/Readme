👥 Customer Analytics Portfolio: Segmentation, Sentiment, Churn & Recommendations
📌 Overview

This portfolio applies Python, Machine Learning, NLP, and Tableau to analyze customer behavior, understand satisfaction, predict churn, and personalize product experiences.
It includes four business-critical use cases used in real organizations:

✅ Customer Segmentation – Identify groups for targeted marketing & personalization
✅ Sentiment Analysis – Understand customer feedback and satisfaction drivers
✅ Churn Dashboard (Tableau) – Monitor and predict customer attrition
✅ Product Recommendation System – Suggest relevant products to increase retention & revenue

Together, these projects show how customer data can drive growth, engagement, and strategic decision-making.

🎯 Business Objectives & Value
Use Case	Business Goal	Business Impact
Segmentation	Group customers by behavior and spending	Personalized campaigns, risk control, upsell opportunities
Sentiment Analysis	Understand product feedback & pain points	Product improvement, targeted messaging, customer satisfaction
Churn Dashboard (Tableau)	Track churn trends & at-risk segments	Reduce churn, improve retention, early intervention
Recommendation Engine	Suggest relevant products to users	Higher order size, engagement, customer lifetime value
✅ 1. Customer Segmentation (Python – K-Means)

Cleaned and standardized transaction data

Applied K-Means clustering to group customers by:
✔ Spending amount
✔ Credit utilization
✔ Payment behavior
✔ Income & balance

Visualized segments using Seaborn & Matplotlib

Key Insight:
“High-spend, on-time payers” are ideal for loyalty rewards, while “high-utilization, late payers” need credit limit controls.

Business Impact:

Better risk management

Improved campaign targeting

Higher engagement from personalized offers

✅ 2. Sentiment Analysis (NLP – Amazon Alexa Reviews)

Tokenized & cleaned review text

Applied TF-IDF and sentiment scoring

Classified reviews into positive / neutral / negative

Identified most common complaint & praise themes

Key Insight:

Positive sentiment driven by convenience & integration

Negative sentiment focused on voice recognition reliability

Business Impact:

Feature improvement roadmap

Reduced customer complaints

Stronger product messaging

✅ 3. Customer Churn Dashboard (Tableau)

🔗 Live Dashboard:

Dashboard Features

Filters by customer segment, location, subscription tier

Churn rate & retention KPIs

Cohort retention analysis

At-risk segment flagging

Visual drilldowns into customer profiles

Key Insights:

Business Impact:

Enables proactive retention strategy

Helps marketing target at-risk users

Supports forecasting & revenue protection

✅ 4. Product Recommendation System

Built using collaborative filtering & cosine similarity

Suggests relevant products based on similarity and purchase patterns

Example Code:

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(pivot_table)
recommended_items = np.argsort(similarity_matrix[item_id])[::-1][1:6]


Business Impact:

Increases basket value

Improves personalization

Enhances customer lifetime value
