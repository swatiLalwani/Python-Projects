🕷️ Data Acquisition and Web Scraping Project
This project demonstrates the ability to independently acquire real-world data from the web, a critical skill for any analyst or BI developer working with data not readily available in a database. It covers the entire lifecycle of external data sourcing, cleaning, and preparation for analysis.

🎯 Business Value
Independent Data Sourcing: Proves the capability to bypass dependency on official APIs or internal databases by extracting public data directly from company websites.

Data Quality Assurance: Focuses on standardizing and cleaning unstructured, raw web data, ensuring the resulting dataset is reliable and structured for subsequent analysis or reporting.

Market Intelligence: The extracted data on companies provides a foundation for competitive analysis, market research, and lead generation.

Process and Methodolgy:
Data Acquisition	Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests)	Successfully wrote and executed a web scraping script to extract key attributes (e.g., company names, contact details, operational statistics) from target company pages.
Data Wrangling	Python (Pandas)	Standardized the unstructured text-based data by cleaning, handling encoding issues, and removing extraneous characters/metadata.
Data Structuring	Data Frame Creation	Transformed the scraped data into a structured Pandas DataFrame ready for export to a structured format (e.g., CSV, SQL database).
Data Validation	Basic Logic Checks	Performed initial checks on the acquired data (as indicated by the companies.numbers file) to ensure consistency and correctness of numerical attributes.

📈 Tools and Files
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Requests (for fetching HTML content), BeautifulSoup (for parsing HTML and extracting data), Pandas (for structuring and cleaning data).

Key Files:

companies.webscrapping project.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping logic, data cleaning steps, and final data structuring.

companies.numbers: Supporting file demonstrating initial data checks or outputs.

Conclusion
This project validates proficiency in Python-based data acquisition and ETL processes. The ability to source and structure external data provides a competitive advantage in roles requiring comprehensive market or competitive intelligence.
