🧩 Overview

This project applies machine learning and statistical analytics to assess financial risk in banking and payment systems.
It includes two high-value business use cases:

✅ Fraud Detection – Identifying abnormal or high-risk transactions
✅ Loan Default Prediction – Estimating likelihood of borrowers failing to repay

Both models demonstrate how data science supports risk mitigation, credit strategy, and financial decision-making in real-world systems.

🎯 Business Objectives
Use Case	Business Goal	Impact
Fraud Detection	Detect suspicious or high-risk transactions in real time	Prevent financial loss and reduce fraud exposure
Loan Repayment Prediction	Identify applicants with a high probability of default	Improve underwriting, reduce loan losses, protect capital
🛠 Methods & Techniques

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical features

Creating new predictors from transaction behavior / credit history

Machine Learning Models

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees / Random Forest

Train-test split + cross-validation

Hyperparameter tuning

Model Evaluation

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

ROC–AUC analysis for fraud classification

Confusion matrices to minimize false negatives

🧮 Example Code: Fraud Model Evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("ROC-AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]))

📊 Key Insights

✅ Fraud Model

Transaction velocity (number of transactions per hour) and unusual merchant location were top predictors

Model achieved ~92% ROC-AUC, reducing false negatives significantly

Helps financial institutions block high-risk payments without impacting good users

✅ Loan Default Model

Created credit risk score from income, debt ratio, payment history

Identified high-risk borrowers ~85% accurately

Enables smarter loan approvals and interest-rate adjustments

✅ Business Impact

✔ Reduces chargebacks and losses from fraudulent payments
✔ Supports smarter lending decisions and healthier loan portfolios
✔ Improves compliance and risk monitoring processes
✔ Enables automated, real-time scoring for finance systems
