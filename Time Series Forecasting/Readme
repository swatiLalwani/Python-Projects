📈 Time Series Forecasting for Business Planning & Financial Analysis
📌 Overview

This project applies time series forecasting techniques to predict future values based on historical performance.
It demonstrates how companies rely on analytics to support budgeting, demand planning, financial forecasting, and risk management.

Models used include:
✅ ARIMA
✅ SARIMA
✅ Prophet (optional)
✅ Trend + Seasonality decomposition

This project can be adapted for sales forecasting, stock price prediction, KPI planning, or operational demand estimation.

🎯 Business Objectives

Identify patterns, seasonal trends, and cyclical behavior

Forecast future performance using historical data

Provide actionable insight for resource planning and financial decisions

Example Dataset:

Tesla Stock Price (Yahoo Finance)

Sales data / monthly revenue dataset (alternative)

🔧 Methods & Workflow

Imported & cleaned time series data using Pandas

Converted data to datetime index

Performed decomposition to extract:

Trend

Seasonality

Residual pattern

Fit forecasting models: ARIMA / SARIMA / Prophet

Evaluated forecast error using:

RMSE

MAPE

MAE

Visualized forecast vs actual values

✅ Key Insights (Example)

Forecast model identifies increasing trend in long-term price movement

Seasonal spike observed near product launch periods

Predicted next 30–90 days of expected movement

Accuracy validated using a train/test split

📊 Sample Code
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
import pandas as pd

model = ARIMA(train['Close'], order=(5,1,2))
fit = model.fit()
pred = fit.forecast(steps=len(test))

mae = mean_absolute_error(test['Close'], pred)
print("MAE:", mae)

✅ Business Impact

✔ Enables forecasting for sales, revenue, or operations
✔ Reduces uncertainty in planning and inventory decisions
✔ Supports scenario planning and budgeting models
✔ Helps organizations anticipate market shifts
